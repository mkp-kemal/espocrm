# Assignment

1. Download the newest version of EspoCRM system [here](https://espocrm.com).
2. Install the system.
3. Create a module named Autocrm that adds a dropdown item called "Find Contacts" to the Lead entity’s record view.
4. When this item is clicked, all contacts (Contact entity) with the same email will be found, and then their first and last names will be displayed back to the user in any form. The form does not really matter – it can even be an alert or printed in the console. The important thing is that the data is sent back to the browser.
